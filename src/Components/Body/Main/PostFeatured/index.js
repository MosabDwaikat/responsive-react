        Claimed by the Void when she was only a child, Kai'Sa managed to survive
        through sheer tenacity and strength of will. Her experiences have made
        her a deadly hunter and, to some, the harbinger of a future they would
        rather not live to see. Having entered into an uneasy symbiosis with a
        living Void carapace, the time will soon come when she must decide
        whether to forgive those mortals who would call her a monster, and
        defeat the coming darkness togetherâ€¦ or simply to forget, as the Void
        consumes the world that left her behind.
